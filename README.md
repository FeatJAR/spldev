# FeatJAR

This is the root project for FeatJAR.
Please report feedback to sebastian.krieter@uni-ulm.de or kuiter@ovgu.de.

## Build instructions

For developers, we recommend to run `git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/` (do not forget the trailing slash) beforehand to push/pull repositories over SSH instead of HTTPS. 

### Ubuntu

Run the following in a shell:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git openjdk-11-jdk
git clone https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatJAR.git && cd FeatJAR
scripts/clone.bat
./gradlew build
```

Installation on other Linux distributions may differ slightly, depending on the package manager.

### Windows

Assuming [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) is installed, run the following in `cmd.exe`: 

```
choco install git openjdk11
git clone https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatJAR.git && cd FeatJAR
scripts\clone.bat
gradlew build
```

Alternatively, follow the steps for Ubuntu in a [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) shell.
    
### macOS

Assuming [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed, run the following in a shell:

```
brew update
brew install git openjdk@11
git clone https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatJAR.git && cd FeatJAR
scripts/clone.bat
./gradlew build
```

### Docker

Assuming [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are installed, run the following in a shell (or, on Windows, in WSL):

```
git clone https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatJAR.git && cd FeatJAR
scripts/clone.bat
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/gradle gradle:7.5.1-jdk11 gradle build
```

## Usage

### As an Executable

```
# test whether a feature model is void
java -jar cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar analyze -i cli/src/test/resources/testFeatureModels/car.xml -a void
  
# or, equivalently, using Gradle
gradlew :cli:run --args "analyze -i src/test/resources/testFeatureModels/car.xml -a void"

# convert a feature model into CNF
java -jar cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar convert \
  -i cli/src/test/resources/testFeatureModels/car.xml -f dimacs -cnf -o car.dimacs

# convert a feature model and analyze it by means of pipes
cat cli/src/test/resources/testFeatureModels/car.xml | \
  java -jar cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar convert -f dimacs -cnf | \
  tail -n +2 | \
  java -jar cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar analyze \
  -i "<stdin:dimacs>" -a cardinality
```

### As a Library

In addition to the repositories under the [FeatureIDE](https://github.com/FeatureIDE) organization, several other tools and evaluations rely on FeatJAR as a library, for example:

* [tseitin-or-not-tseitin](https://github.com/ekuiter/tseitin-or-not-tseitin): Automated evaluation of CNF transformations' impact on feature-model analyses
* [variED-NG](https://github.com/ekuiter/variED-NG): A collaborative, real-time feature model editor

### In FeatureIDE

To use FeatJAR during FeatureIDE development, import the FeatJAR root folder as a Gradle project with default settings in Eclipse (`File > Import... > Gradle > Existing Gradle project`).
Then you can use any FeatJAR repository (e.g., `util`) in any Eclipse project by adding it to the project's build path (`Right click project > Properties > Java Build Path > Projects > Add...`).
